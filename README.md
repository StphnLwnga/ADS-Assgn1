This assignment covers the fundamentals of the `pandas` python data analysis library.  
Basic usage involves the following steps:
- Importing the package, together with the `NumPy` package that provides functions for working with multidimensional arrays and matrices; and the `maptplotlib` data visualisation package.
- Loading the data from a source into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Applying `pandas.DataFrame` methods which provide an overview understanding of the dataset.
- Cleaning the dataset e.g. purging `NaN` values, stripping out unnecessary characters from values, converting datatypes to their required format.
- Performing the various mathematical computations on the dataset to obtain variables that can be plotted and visaulized using `matplotlib`
